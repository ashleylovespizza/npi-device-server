==========

Socket server for NPI devices to connect to.  Routes messages, uses Beanstalkd to 
handle queued tasks (probably eventually).


TESTS:
++++++

We're on a plane, and so can't download a test framework at the moment.  So, how 
we just list out a few tests we're gonna wanna run later, and just stub this app
out as best we can whilst in the sky at 500mph.

describe Server

	 it "should start with a success message"
	 it "should allow client connections on port 12311"
	 it "should echo messages from one client to another client"


GOALS:
